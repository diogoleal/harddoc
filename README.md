# infoserver2wiki
List some operating system information and creates a text file in the format dokuwiki

## Created functions:
* FQDN and hostname
* Number of CPUS
* Total Memory
* Enabled processes in the operating system boot (RHEL6, Ubuntu e Gentoo)
* Iptables rules
* Interfaces and the network address
* Mounted partitions
* Show crontab

## ToDo
Soon I will implement:
* List created users and groups that are not system
* Configured routes
* Repositories configured

And then:
* Record information directly to dokuwiki
* Options for more than one type of wiki mediawiki like, for example.
